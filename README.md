# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
To help our friend Britta prepare for an upcoming hackathon, she requested we pull data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens rating data into a SQL database that participants can use. 

## Resources
- Extract, Transform, Load process
- SQL 
- Pandas, Numpy, JSON, SQLalchemy in Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
Extracted data from multiple sources, transformed data for enhanced consistency, removal of uncessary data, and improved data formatting. Once extraction and tranformations were complete, the data was loaded into a SQL table.
